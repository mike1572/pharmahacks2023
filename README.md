This project aims to establish the indicative conditions, features, and patterns of a sufficient production of human cardiomocytes from HPSCs. Differentiation causes cells to undergo major changes in their shape, size, and metabolism. These concepts served as the guide for which parameters in the dataset were most likely to be biologically relevant, with the aid of a literature review on known cellular changes during differentiation. The preparatory conditions were dropped, as they were fairly consistent across samples. A second selection round happened to eliminate variables which are similar representations of changes in cell shape, size and metabolism status in order to reduce variance(?). 

The most reliable model was the Random Forest Regression. We initially attempted a regression analysis to train the model, followed by a classification of the predicted dd10 CM content. This method produced relaible true negatives, but was very vulnerable to false negatives due to its ?????????. As a result, we changed our approach to a classification method where only datasets that produced sufficient CM content, which was then used to classify the test data. This method produced more consistent true positive results, leading to an increase in model performance according to given metrics.
