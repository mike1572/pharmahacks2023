This project aims to establish the key conditions that will optimize production of human cardiomocytes from HPSCs. Differentiation causes cells to undergo major changes in their shape, size, and metabolism. These signs of change then served as the guide for which parameters, or rather indicators, to be picked, with the aid of a literature review on known changes in cells during differentiation. A second selection round happened to eliminate variables which are similar representations changes in cell shape, size and metabolism status, but less precise than another in order to reduce variance. 


Of all models used, the most reliable predictor was the Random Forest Regression. We initially attempted a regression analysis to train the model, followed by a classification of the predicted dd10 CM content. This method produced relaible true negatives, but was very vulnerable to false negatives due to its ?????????. As a result, we changed our approach to a classification method where only datasets that produced sufficient CM content, which was then used to classify the test data. This method produced more consistent true positive results, leading to an increase in accuracy, precision,
